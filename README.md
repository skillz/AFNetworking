# AFNetworking
## A delightful iOS networking library with NSOperations and block-based callbacks
### There's a lot to be said for a networking library that you can wrap your head around. API design matters, too. Code at its best is poetry, and should be designed to delight (but never surprise).

AFNetworking was lovingly crafted to make best use of our favorite parts of Apple's `Foundation` framework: `NSOperation` for managing multiple concurrent requests, `NSURLRequest` & `NSHTTPURLResponse` to encapsulate state, `NSCache` & `NSURLCache` for performant and compliant cacheing behavior, and blocks to keep request / response handling code in a single logical unit in code.

If you're tired of massive libraries that try to do too much...  
If you've taken it upon yourself to roll your own hacky solution...  
If you want a library that _actually makes iOS networking code kinda fun_...

## Example Usage

### JSON Request

``` objective-c
NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"https://gowalla.com/users/mattt.json"]];
AFJSONRequestOperation *operation = [AFJSONRequestOperation operationWithRequest:request success:^(id JSON) {
    NSLog(@"Name: %@ %@", [JSON valueForKeyPath:@"first_name"], [JSON valueForKeyPath:@"last_name"]);
}];
[[NSOperationQueue mainQueue] addOperation:operation];
```

### Image Request

``` objective-c
UIImageView *imageView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0.0f, 0.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f)];
    [imageView setImageWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://i.imgur.com/r4uwx.jpg"] placeholderImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"placeholder-avatar"]];
```

### File Upload with Progress Callback

``` objective-c
NSMutableURLRequest *request = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://localhost:8080/upload"]];
NSData *imageData = UIImageJPEGRepresentation([UIImage imageNamed:@"avatar.jpg"], 0.5);
NSDictionary *parameters = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:@"300x300" forKey:@"dimensions"];
[request setHTTPBodyWithData:imageData mimeType:@"image/jpeg" forParameterNamed:@"avatar" parameters:parameters useGzipCompression:YES];

AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation = [AFHTTPRequestOperation operationWithRequest:request completion:^(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse *response, NSData *data, NSError *error) {
    NSLog(@"Upload Complete");
}];
[operation setProgressBlock:^(NSUInteger totalBytesWritten, NSUInteger totalBytesExpectedToWrite) {
    NSLog(@"Sent %d of %d bytes", totalBytesWritten, totalBytesExpectedToWrite);
}];
[[NSOperationQueue mainQueue] addOperation:operation];
```

### Request With HTTP Authorization Header

``` objective-c
NSMutableURLRequest *request = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"https://gowalla.com/friendships/request?user_id=1699"]];
[request setHTTPMethod:@"POST"];

NSDictionary *headers = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"Token token=\"%@\"", kOAuthToken] forKey:@"Authorization"];
[request setAllHTTPHeaderFields:headers];

AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation = [AFHTTPRequestOperation operationWithRequest:request completion:^(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse *response, NSData *data, NSError *error) {
    BOOL HTTPStatusCodeIsAcceptable = [[NSIndexSet indexSetWithIndexesInRange:NSMakeRange(200, 100)] containsIndex:[response statusCode]];
    if (HTTPStatusCodeIsAcceptable) {
        NSLog(@"Friend Request Sent");
    } else {
        NSLog(@"[Error]: (%@ %@) %@", [request HTTPMethod], [[request URL] relativePath], error);
    }
}];

[[NSOperationQueue mainQueue] addOperation:operation];
```

### REST API Client Request

``` objective-c
// AFGowallaAPIClient is a subclass of AFRestClient, which defines the base URL and default HTTP headers for NSURLRequests it creates
[[AFGowallaAPIClient sharedClient] getPath:@"/spots/9223" parameters:nil success:^(id response) {
    NSLog(@"Name: %@", [response valueForKeyPath:@"name"]);
    NSLog(@"Address: %@", [response valueForKeyPath:@"address.street_address"]);
}];
```

### Streaming Request

``` objective-c
NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://localhost:8080/encode"]];
NSInputStream *inputStream = [NSInputStream inputStreamWithFileAtPath:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"large-image" ofType:@"tiff"]];
NSOutputStream *outputStream = [NSOutputStream outputStreamToMemory];
AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation = [AFHTTPRequestOperation operationWithRequest:request inputStream:inputStream outputStream:outputStream completion:^(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {
    NSLog(@"Streaming operation complete");
}];
```

## Example Project

In order to demonstrate the power and flexibility of AFNetworking, we've included a small sample project, which asks for your current location and displays [Gowalla](http://gowalla.com/) spots nearby you. It uses `AFJSONRequestOperation` to load and parse the spots JSON, and a category on `UIImageView` to asynchronously load spot stamp images as you scroll.

## Dependencies

* [iOS 4.0+](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniPhoneOS/Articles/iPhoneOS4.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009559-SW1) - AFNetworking uses blocks, which were introduced in iOS 4.

If you're using iOS 5, AFJSONRequestOperation uses JSON will use the built-in NSJSONSerialization class to parse JSON responses. If this is not available, it falls back on [JSONKit](https://github.com/johnezang/JSONKit).
